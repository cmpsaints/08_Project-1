## About briX

Our game, briX, is a game we built using JS where the user moves a paddle back and forth to bounce a ball into blocks to "hit" the blocks. Blocks will continue to move downward as the game progresses, and the goal is to not allow bricks to touch the bottom wall, or to allow the ball to bounce off of the bottom wall.

If a user is looking for an easy game to learn and play that tests their kinetic skills, they've come to the right place!

## Results and Technologies Used
__Firebase__. The game takes user input using content from a Materialize modal and stores their nickname into Firebase. This will be used later to store high scores. We also use input validation to check if the nickname already exists in our database.

__HTML/CSS/Materialize__. The game uses HTML/CSS/Materialize for visuals. 

__Javascript/jQuery__. We used the JS canvas for the game visuals. JS DOM manipulation for game controls as well as for invoking the win/lose conditions.

__APIs__. We used Giphy and Youtube APIs to add music and visuals. We implemented a checkbox to mute or play the music.
